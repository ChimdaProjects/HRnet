# HRnet

HRnet is an application that manages employee records. The application is old and uses jQuery on the front end, which leads to considerable bugs and increased internal complaints.

My mission as a front-end developer is to :

- Convert the whole HRNet project to ReactJs.
- Convert one of the four current jQuery plugins to ReactJs. (Publish the React component on npm as a package)
- Replace the 3 remaining jQuery plugins with React components
- Perform Lighthouse performance tests comparing the old and new application.

## Launching the project (front-end)

- Fork this repository
- Clone it on your computer
- The `npm install` command will allow you to install the dependencies.
- The `npm start` command will allow you to run the front-end.`
